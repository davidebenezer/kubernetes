Rolling Update
**************

$ kubectl get deployments

$ kubectl edit deployments my-deployment

update ngnix image from 1.19.1 to 1.19.2

This will automatically trigger a rolling update

check rollout status
********************

$ kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment

$ kubectl get deployment
$ kubectl get pods

Another way to do rolling update(intentionally give wrong image and record)
***************************************************************************

$ kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment nginx=nginx:broken --record

$ kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment

it will not finish till the updates are completed
ctrl+c and check the get pods

Original pods should be still up and new pod will have an Image Error

check rollout history
*********************
$ kubectl rollout history deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment


Rollback
********
--to-revision is needed if we need to rollback to any older revision other than previous one. For rolling back to previous revision
  this flag is not needed

$ kubectl rollout undo deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment --to-revision=2

$ kubectl rollout undo deployment.v1.apps/my-deployment

Managing Kubernetes Applications with Deployments
Introduction
Deployments offer a wide range of features for automating application management. In this lab, you will put your knowledge of deployments to the test. You will use an existing deployment to scale an application, as well as perform a rolling update.

Solution
Log in to the Control Plane Node server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Update the App to a New Version of the Code
Edit the beebox-web deployment:

kubectl edit deployment beebox-web
Locate the Pod's container specification, and change the 1.0.1 image version tag to 1.0.2:

...

spec:
  containers:
  - image: acgorg/beebox-web:1.0.2
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: web-server

...
Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

Check the status of your deployment to watch the rolling update occur:

kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/beebox-web
Scale the App to a Larger Number of Replicas
Scale the deployment to 5 replicas:

kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/beebox-web --replicas=5
View the deployment to watch it scale up:

kubectl get deployment beebox-web
View the Pods:

kubectl get pods
