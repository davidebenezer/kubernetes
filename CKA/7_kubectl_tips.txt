Declarative
***********

Define objects using data structures such as YAML or JSON

***
Imperative commands
*******************

Define Objects using kubectl commands and flags. Some people find imperative commands faster. Experiment and see what works for you


	***
	Deployment
	**********

	kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx

	***
	Quick sample Yaml file
	**********************

	Use the --dry-run flag to run an imperative command without creating an object. Combine it with -o yaml to quickly obtain a sample YAML file 
		you can manipulate.

	kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml

	kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > 7.1-redirect-imperative-to-file-deploymment.yml(dry-run depricated, use dry-run=client)

	***
	Record a Command
	****************

	Use the --record flag to record the command that was used to make a change.

	$kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas 5 --record

	$kubectl describe deployment my-deployment (we can view the command used for changing the object)

***
Use the Docs
************
You can often find YAML examples in the Kubernetes documentation. You are allowed to use this documentation during the exam.
	Feel free to copy and paste example YAML and/or commands from the docs!
