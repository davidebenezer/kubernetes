Worker Node

Static Pods
===========

default manifest path for kubeadm /etc/kubernetes/manifests

vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/my-static-pod.yml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-static-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.19.1
    
# kubelet automatically scans the manifest and creates the static pods.
# if you want the changes to be reflected immediately, restart kubelet in the worker node.
  # $ sudo systemctl restart kubelet

We cannot delete the static pod from apiserver

$ kubectl delete pod <static pod>
  it will delte the mirror pod, but it will again come up

$ kubectl get pods
It will again show up

Using Static Pods in Kubernetes
Introduction
Static pods are a great way to run a pod on a single node without the involvement of the Kubernetes control plane. In this lab, you will have a chance to exercise your knowledge of static pods by creating them in an existing cluster.

Create a Manifest for a Static Pod
Log in to the Worker Node 1 server:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Create a static pod manifest file:

[cloud_user@k8s-worker1]$ sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/beebox-diagnostic.yml
Add the following into the file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: beebox-diagnostic
spec:
  containers:
  - name: beebox-diagnostic
    image: acgorg/beebox-diagnostic:1
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

Start Up the Static Pod
Restart kubelet to start the static pod:

[cloud_user@k8s-worker1]$ sudo systemctl restart kubelet
In a new terminal session, log in to the Control Plane Node server:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Check the status of your static Pod:

[cloud_user@k8s-control]]$ kubectl get pods
Attempt to delete the static Pod using the k8s API:

[cloud_user@k8s-control]]$ kubectl delete pod beebox-diagnostic-k8s-worker1
Check the status of the Pod:

[cloud_user@k8s-control]]$ kubectl get pods
We'll see the Pod was immediately re-created, since it is only a mirror Pod created by the worker kubelet to represent the static Pod.
